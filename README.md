# Dotfiles
Aarnav's files with dots in them.<br>
While these are mostly for me you may find them useful<br>
Just download the `configure` folder and run `bootstrap.sh`<br>
The following dotfiles are here:
- Zsh plugins without a manager
- Pure Theme by Sindresorhus
- Launchd Tasks
	- Cleanup task to remove daily files
	- Network managing files to improve gamestreaming
- Git hooks + Husky handling for JS projects
- Theos (https://github.com/theos/theos)
- Brew + Bundle (see Brewfile)
- Small (but useful) functions for maintaining the dotfiles
- macOS and Linux bootstrap files
- A simple Golang environment
- Dart support
- Node version management
- Epic aliases and laziness variables
